# Algorithms

The simplest definition of an algorithm is a set of instructions that are to be followed. When discussing algorithms we are typically discussing methods to efficiently solve problems.

This directory covers a variety of topics related to algorithms including, but not limited to:

- Basic notation (logarithms, Big O)
- Search and sort methods
- Data structures and an analysis of their efficiency
- Problem solving techniques
- Famous algorithms

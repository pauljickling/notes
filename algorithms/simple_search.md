## Simple Search

A simple search looks for items in a list by going from the start of the list, and going through each item in the list. A typical for or while loop is an implementation of a simple search.

A simple search takes O(n) time. O(n) is called linear time. Linear time is when the number of steps taken are equal to the size of the list.

## Selection Sort

Selection sort is an algorithm that goes through an unsorted list, and rearranges the items in the list until they are in a sorted order.

The efficiency of a selection sort is O(n<sup>2</sup>). When performing a selection sort it has to go through the the entire list to find the item it is looking for, and then relocate that item, and then repeat that process until the entire list has been sorted. Therefore it is the length of the list (n) multiplied by the number of items in the list (n).

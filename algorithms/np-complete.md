## NP Complete

NP is short for *nondeterministic polynomial time*. NP complete problems are problems that are likely impossible to solve efficiently, and therefore it is usually best to try to solve using an approximation instead. Approximate solutions often involve greedy algorithms, which always select the locally optimal decision even if it is at the expense of overall optimization.

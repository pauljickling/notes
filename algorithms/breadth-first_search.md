## Breadth-First Search

A breadth-first search is a graph algorithm that is used to find if a path exists between two points, and if so the shortest distance between them.

The breadth-first search answers its two questions by checking the neighbors of the starting node to see if it satisfies the condition of the search. If not, only then will it move onto nodes that are two steps away from the starting node. By searching in this sort of order, the breadth-first search algorithm forms a *queue*.

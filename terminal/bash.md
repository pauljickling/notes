# Bash

The start of a bash file begins with `#!/bin/bash`

`#` is used for comments.

In bash you can run anything that you would run on the command line. This makes bash scripts incredibly useful for build processes that require multiple steps to run.

## Variables

Example of assigning a variable in Bash:

`$(shasum -a 256 $filename)`

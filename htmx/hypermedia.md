# Hypermedia

Notes on the book that can be found on [hypermedia.systems](hypermedia.systems).

## Chapter 1: Introduction

A hypermedia system is any system that adheres to a RESTful network architecture. The author emphasizes that they are not talking about JSON APIs that are often referred to as RESTful APIs since JSON lacks hypermedia controls. Instead it refers to a network where the exchange of hypermedia is built into the system.

# Mail

If you run cron jobs on your machine, you may encounter a a message like `You have new messages` when starting up a new session or tab. You can check these messages by typing `mail` which will put you in an interactive prompt. From there it should show messages available, and you can hit `p` for "print" to read the message. You can `ctrl+c` to terminate the session at any time.

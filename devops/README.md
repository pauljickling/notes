# DevOps Readme

DevOps is a practice, not a technology stack. It is the practice of breaking down the silos within an organization between development work, and operations work. As such, it is partly a deployment strategy as outlined in [the Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/), and it is partly a social practice within an organization.

That being said, naturally there are tools that lend themselves to the practice of DevOps, some of which are covered here. This DevOps folder is a bit of a misnomer. It covers a hodge podge of topics including cloud platform documentation, config management tools, backend server architecture, app containers, etc. These are all technical processes that can easily be documented and described. The hard part of DevOps however is the social component. There is no walkthrough document you can follow for that because every organization with have unique needs and people you need to interact with.

# Key Management

[Using Keybase, GPG, and Git to sign commits](https://github.com/pstadler/keybase-gpg-github)

Keybase has been less reliable at this time of writing (2024) with several outages from bad certs, so it is good to have processes in place that don't rely on it. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key) is an alternative setup that doesn't require keybase.

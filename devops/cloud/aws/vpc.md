# VPC

VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. It allows one to setup public and private subnets in a network. The private subnet will allow different AWS resources to communicate with each other (databases, backend APIs, etc.) while the public subnet will accept and direct internet traffic.

An excellent walkthrough on setting up a VPC via the AWS console or Terraform can be found [here](https://spgl.in/blog/2022/07/how-to-cloud-instantly-set-up-a-vpc-for-public-and-private-traffic/).

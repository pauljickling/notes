# AWS S3

S3 is a storage service. S3 stores objects with what is called a "bucket".

## Creating a Bucket

When you create a bucket you have to give it a DNS-compliant name (i.e. something URL friendly), and select a region where it lives.

### Configuration Options

Configuration options include:

- Object Versioning (i.e. do we want to keep the history of a modified object?)
- Server Access Logging
- Tags
- Object-level Logging (additional costs associated with this option that provides the object-level API activity)
- Encryption
- Object Lock (feature of object versioning)
- CloudWatch request metrics (additional costs associated with this option)

### Permissions

By default S3 buckets block public access however there are various possible configurations for more permissive access options such as making objects within a bucket public, account specific access to a bucket, etc.

## Bucket Console

From the bucket console, you can upload files, view files, and manage files via a basic file manager system.

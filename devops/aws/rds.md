 # AWS RDS

RDS stands for Relational Database Service. AWS RDS supports, among others, the following database engines:

- MySQL
- MariaDB
- PostgreSQL

The computation and memory capacity is determined by its DB instance class.

Storage comes in magnetic, general purpose (SSD), and Provisioned IOPS.

DB instances are run through a virtual private cloud where you can control the virtual networking environment that allows you to have control over an IP address range, subnets, and routing and access control lists. VPCs make it possible to configure your DB instance to work alongside your EC2 instance.

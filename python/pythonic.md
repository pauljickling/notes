# Writing Pythonic Code

"Pythonic" code, also sometimes referred to as idiomatic Python, is a particular way of writing code that is considered better form. Other Python developers will typically expect you to write code this way.

## List Comprehensions

`arr = [i for i in other_list]`

## Destructuring

`(a, b, c) = [5, 10, 15]`

## Enumeration

```
for index, element in enumerate(arr):
    print(index, element)
```

## Converting a List into a String

`hello = ''.join(['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'])`

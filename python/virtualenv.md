## Virtual Environment

The best practice when working Python projects is to create a virtual environment so that configuration options are isolated from other projects that are being worked on.

### Setup

From the terminal run:

```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Once that is setup you can go ahead and install dependencies via pip.

### Exiting Virtual Environment

The virtual environment can be exited via the `deactivate` command.

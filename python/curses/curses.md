# Curses

Curses (along with ncurses i.e. new curses) is an older library for the C language that allows you to write scripts that act as interactive terminal applications (think of tools like vim or roguelike games). Python has a curses library as part of the std lib that acts as a wrapper. It is extremely portable and works in most Unix environments and even in things like MS-DOS.

# Volka Keys

The Volka Keys is a small analog synth with built-in delay effects by Korg.

## Synthesis Overview

### VCO (Voltage Controlled Ocillator)

The VCO specifies the basis of sound for the Volka Keys. It is controlled with the ocave knob, which has doubling values from 1 to 32, and specifies the pitch range of the keyboard. It is also controlled by the voice knob, which sets the operation mode for the VCO:

- **POLY:** Up to three chords of a sawtooth wave can be played
- **UNISON:** A sawtooth wave at the same pitch produced by three VCOs
- **OCTAVE:** A sawtooth wave generated by two notes, one octave apart
- **FIFTH:** A sawtooth wave generated by two notes, one fifth apart
- **UNISON RING:** Three VCOs are used to produce sound with ring modulation applied to the square wave
- **POLY RING:** Three chords are played with ring modulation applied to the square wave

Additionally there are knobs for detuning the sound, portamento (i.e. pitch sliding), and EG intensity (see the EG section for more info).

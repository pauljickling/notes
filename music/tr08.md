# TR-08

The Roland TR-08 is a drum machine that emulates the infamous 808.

## Selecting a Pattern

The `Start/Stop` button changes how the number sequence buttons operate. When in the `STOP` position it is used to select a pattern. When it is in the `START` position it is used to insert instrument sounds within a bar sequence.

## Clearing a Pattern

Move the `PATTERN WRITE` knob to `PATTERN CLEAR`. Press the red `PATTERN CLEAR` button and select the pattern to clear. Note that the `A/B` switch position matters.

## Write a B Pattern

Writing to the B pattern is as simple as switching the A/B switch to the B position. When in the center it will alternate between A and B.

## Write a Second Part

There is in fact always a second part playing when you create a pattern, however by default the pattern is set to 0 steps, so in effect nothing happens. By adjusting the Pattern Write knob to the 2nd part, and holding the `PATTERN CLEAR` red button, you can then select 1 - 16 for the number of steps to include.

## Programming Sounds via Tap

In addition to being able to program sounds by selecting the sequence in the bar, you can also use the tap button and it will insert the selected instrument at that position within the bar. This is useful for live edits.

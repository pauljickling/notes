# Korg SQ-64

The Korg SQ-64 is a compact 64 step sequencer that works especially well with devices that have CV/Gate inputs, although it also has a MIDI input and 2 MIDI outputs that require 3.5" Series A MIDI cables, as well as a sync in and sync out that work with a variety of Korg devices such as the Volca series.

## MIDI Connections

After connecting a device to receive MIDI input you can select one of the four tracks you want to assign it to (A, B, C, or D) and press the GLOBAL button until you are on the MIDI TX menu. From there you can select the MIDI channel to send data to your device.

## Keyboard Mode

Briefly hold the PITCH and Track button to enter keyboard mode where you can use the sequence buttons as a keyboard for your device.

# SE-02

## Basic Controls

The lower left switch is known as the "Mode select switch", and it controls the basic functionality of the SE-02 with `PATCH`, `SEQ`, and `SONG` modes.

## SEQUENCING

Set the mode select switch to `SEQ`. The SE-02 has storage for 128 sequences. These can be selected with the value knob at the lower-left, or by inputting the numbers with the number buttons. Patterns that have been edited will have a dot in the lower right corner of the display.

### Clearing a Sequence

Press the `NOTE` and `GATE` buttons together. Then select the red button to select the clear pattern option, and press down on the value knob to confirm.

### Creating a Sequence

While in `SEQ` mode, press the `NOTE` button. Now select the notes (1-16) you want to use. You can change the pitch of a note by selecting the note and pressing the button on a MIDI controller. You can also you the value knob to adjust the note.

### Editing a Sequence

Press the `GATE` button, select the note you want to use, and use the value knob to adjust a value of 1-100. 100 means there is no gap between the current note and the next note in the sequence, whereas 1 would create a very long gap.

Press the `GLIDE` button, select the notes you want to use, and adjust the glide knob to create some slides between notes.

Press the `PRM` (parameter) button to change the parameters (i.e. oscillators, XMPOD, mixer, filter/envelopes, lfo, and delay) for the notes.

The `PERFORM` button can be used to adjust the scale of the notes, add shuffle, and select the direction of the sequence (forward, reverse, alternating, and random).

## Connecting another device to the SE-02

Connect the trigger out of the other device to the trigger in for the SE-02. Hold down the `NOTE` and `GATE` buttons, and you can change the sync option from `INT` for internal, to USB, MIDI or trigger.

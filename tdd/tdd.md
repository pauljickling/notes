# Testing Driven Development

TDD follows this process:

1. Write a test
2. Run a test and check that it fails as expected
3. Write relevant function/app/component
4. Run test again until it passes
5. Write a new test

## Best Practices

1. Each test should test one thing
2. One test file per application code source file
3. A test for every function/class
4. Don't test constants
5. Test behavior, not implementation
6. Always think about edge cases
